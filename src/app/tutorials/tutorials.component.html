              <li>Algorithmic trading is using pre-programmed instructions to automatically conduct trades, based on factors including time, price and other market conditions.</li>
              <li>The foreign exchange market (Forex), is buying and selling foreign currencies to try to make a profit. For example, if you are trading in Pounds, you could buy Euros when the Euro is weak and so has a low price, then sell them when the Euro is stronger and worth more.</li>
            </ul>

          Using algorithms to trade forex can be very profitable. However, many people don’t have the time to write algorithms themselves. Our platform connects you with developers who have the time and skills to write these algorithms, but maybe don’t have the money to invest themselves. You can choose somebody’s algorithm and, for a cut of the profits negotiated between the two of you, use it to trade forex. We take care of the hard work, you can just input the money and wait for the profits!

          <br><br>
          Here you create your offer. Enter the percentage of the profits you want take, the amount of money you want to invest, and the date you want to end the investment period. If your offer is accepted, the money will be taken from your account and, after the time period ends, your remaining money will be sent back to you along with your cut of the profits!
          <br><br>
          The developer may respond with a counter-offer instead of accepting. These will show up in your inbox for you to accept, decline, or respond with another counter.
