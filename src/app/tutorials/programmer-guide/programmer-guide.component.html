          Welcome to justForex! This is a platform to write and test foreign exchange trading algorithms in an easy, stress free way, and make money by getting investors to trade with your algorithms!

              <li>Algorithmic trading is using pre-programmed instructions to automatically conduct trades, based on factors including time, price and other market conditions.</li>
              <li>The foreign exchange market (Forex), is buying and selling foreign currencies to try to make a profit. For example, if you are trading in Pounds, you could buy Euros when the Euro is weak and so has a low price, then sell them when the Euro is stronger and worth more.</li>
            </ul>

          Our site allows you to write algorithms in Python with which to trade forex, and to test the algorithms without using your own money.
          <br><br>
          See the next page to learn about writing an algorithm.

          Here you can click 'new file' to start a new file and write your python code. The 'run' button attempts to compile the algorithm and puts output in the terminal beneath. When finished, click 'save'. Then you can click 'run backtests' and see how well your algorithm performs!

          If your algorithm does well, it may end up on the leaderboard! That is where potential investors can find you!

          The leaderboard consists of all of the algorithms performing well this week. Each looks like this:

          If an investor sees your algorithm and likes what they see, they can send you an offer.

          You can accept it in which case the trading will begin. At the end of the time period, any profits will be split according to the split agreed upon and your cut will be credited to your account.
          <br><br>
          If you don't like the offer, you may respond with a counter-offer. The investor can respond with another counter and so on until one of you accepts or declines.
