          Using algorithms to trade forex can be very profitable. However, many people don’t have the time to write algorithms themselves. Our platform connects you with developers who have the time and skills to write these algorithms, but maybe don’t have the money to invest themselves. You can choose somebody’s algorithm and, for a cut of the profits negotiated between the two of you, use it to trade forex. We take care of the hard work, you can just input the money and wait for the profits!
